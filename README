Echolot is a Pinger for anonymous remailers.

A Pinger in the context of anonymous remailers is a program that
regularily sends messages through remailers to check their reliability.
It then calculates reliability statistics which are used by remailer
clients to choose the chain of remailers to use.

Additionally it collects configuration parameters and keys of all
remailers and offers them in a format readable by remailer clients.


This is echolot2. Besides the name, author and purpose this has nothing
to do with echolot1. It's written from scratch.

LICENSE
-------
Please see the file named "LICENSE".


REQUIREMENTS
------------
	in general:
		Data::Dumper (should be part of perl-base)
		Digest::MD5
		HTML::Template
		a local Mail Transfer Agent
	for type1 pings
		GnuPG (1.0.7)
		GnuPG::Interface (0.33)
	for type2 pings
		a mixmaster installation
FIXME what else

Indirect requirements:
	Class:MethodMaker (by GnuPG::Interface)

SETUP
-----

o Create a new unix user named »pinger« (You can actually use any name
  you wish but I will refer to the user as pinger in this document).

o Make sure you have the perl libraries mentioned above and GnuPG
  installed properly.

o Create a mixmaster client installation in ~pinger/Mix echolot needs to
  have its own installation because it will mess with mix' mlist.txt
  file, the public mixmaster keyring, and type2.list.  Don't bother
  putting current keyrings there.

o copy all echolot files and directories to ~pinger/echolot

o Check the homedir setting and set sitename in pingd.conf.

o Set my_localpart and my_domain in pingd.conf to the appropriate values
  for your pinger. Mail to my_localpart@my_domain needs to reach
  echolot.

o Make sure your MTA supports user defined mailboxes. so that
  my_localpart+anything@my_domain also reaches echolot.
              ^^^^^^^^^
  If you use another character instead or + to indicate a user defined
  extension set recipient_delimiter accordingly in pingd.conf.

o Mail should be delivered to /home/pinger/echolot/mail which must be a Maildir
  mailbox, i.e there are 3 directories: /home/pinger/echolot/mail/tmp,
  /home/pinger/echolot/mail/cur and /home/pinger/echolot/mail/new. Qmail,
  postfix and procmail can do this.

  Example snipped for procmail:

    :0
    $HOME/echolot/mail/
  
  (the trailing slash is important!)


  Example for qmail:

    echo "./echolot/mail/" > .qmail;
    touch .qmail-default


o run »./pingd --verbose start«

o run »./pingd add <address> <address> <address>..« in another terminal
  look at the first terminal where you started pingd. It should print
  something about adding addresses.

o run »./pingd getkeyconf« to request new remailer-key and
  remailer-conf immediatly.

o pingd can be stopped with »./pingd stop« or with Ctrl+C on the
  terminal where it runs.

When everything works you may start pingd with

o »./pingd --detach --verbose start«

o You can tail the output file to get the debugging output:
  »tail -f output«



CONFIGURATION
-------------

Run »./pingd dumpconf« to see a list of all available configuration
options.  You may add them to the pingd.conf file. After changing that
file you need to restart pingd.
