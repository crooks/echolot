Echolot is a Pinger for anonymous remailers.

A Pinger in the context of anonymous remailers is a program that regularily
sends messages through remailers to check their reliability. It then
calculates reliability statistics which are used by remailer clients to
choose the chain of remailers to use.

Additionally it collects configuration parameters and keys of all remailers
and offers them in a format readable by remailer clients.


This is echolot2. Besides the name, author and purpose this has nothing to do
with echolot1. It's written from scratch.
