Changes in
	* Update FSF address in all files.

Changes in version 2.1.8 - 2005-04-25
	* debian: Redirect init script output to /dev/null in logrotate

Changes in version 2.1.7 - 2004-11-15
	* debian: Add disable and enable to allowed commands in init
	  script
	* debian: Create echolot user group in proper gid space.
	* debian: remove debconf stuff.
	* handle empty environment better - previously we would whine
	  when HOME or PATH were not set.

Changes in version 2.1.6 - 2004-08-07
	* Catch a possible use of undefined values in a log trace() call.

Changes in version 2.1.5 - 2004-06-22
	* Fix use of an illegal filedescriptor when we know of a remailer,
	  but do not have keys for it yet/anymore.
	* Check if syswrite's return value is defined
	  (also is: do not write to gpg forever, once it has died or
	  closed its stdin).
	* Tell Mixmaster to create no dummies.  It has no remailer keys
	  and reliability information anyway.
	* Increase the number of remailers that need to list an address
	  before it is added to 6.  It was 3 previously.
	* Make set fetch=<value> work again.
	* Make disable and enable actually work.

Changes in version 2.1.4 - 2004-06-10
	* Have new disable and enable commands which are shortcut
	  for set pingit=off showit=off fetch=off and =on respectively.
	* Accept show=, ping=, and fetchit= in addition to their real
	  names in set.
	* Do not accept expired or future mixmaster keys.
	* Print summary on notice level, not info, if it was requested
	  manually.
	* Remove get_remailers since get_addresses in Echolot::Storage::File
	  does almost the same.
	* Make sure we do not create empty key hashes in metadata.
	* gpg interaction cleanup, move a lot of duplicated code to
	  Echolot::Tools.
	* Filter out mixmaster outputs to stderr that are no problem.
	* There's a TRACE loglevel now, which is even more noisy than DEBUG.
	* Changed all pointers to savannah to alioth.
	* Removed obsolete tools to convert echolot setups during 2.0beta*
	  releases.
	* Handle situations better in which a ping receives when the last
	  key already is expired, and the remailer no longer exists in
	  the remailers part of the metadata (only in the addresses part).
	* Add a file that describes how Echolot works.

Changes in version 2.1.3 - 2004-04-20
	* Improvements to pingd.conf(5) by Colin.
	* Use 'Apr' instead of 'Arp' for April.  closes: DebianBug#243504.

Changes in version 2.1.2 - 2003-11-04
	* Also ignore testing remailers in the thesaurus.
	* Also ignore testing remailers in fromlines.

Changes in version 2.1.1 - 2003-11-02
	* Fix 0/false in Fetch/Ping/Show in summary report.
	* fork() for calling mixmaster, so we can exec() it
	  rather can using open("| ...") which ivokes a shell.
	* Catch SIGPIPE and log it as error.
	* Document thesaurusindexfile.
	* Minor documentation fixes.
	* When asked to shut down, exit immediatly after the current running
	  task, even if we have a backlog.
	* If we run late we should now drop actions where it does not hurt.
	* Remove random command invocation via pingctr/init script.  People
	  should just call pingd directly.  Also wait for pingd to really
	  shut down in stop and restart.
	* Regularily clean up the temp directory.
	* Send out pings every two hours by default.
	* Modified statistics generation:
	  We no longer assume a normal distribution of latencies but instead
	  use percentiles when calculating a life probability of an outstanding
	  ping.  Also we do not show the mean of latency but the median as
	  this seems to be 'more correct'.
	  Also have different weights for pings based on their age.
	* Optimized chain pinging: takes less CPU.
	* Do not list remailers with the 'testing' capability in
	  public stats.  Testing indicates a node is not ready for real
	  users' traffic yet.
	* Publish operator's address on index page.
	* Refuse to run with euid == 0.

Changes in version 2.1 - 2003-03-03
	* Minor documentation fixes suggested by Ryan Lackey.
	* Adjusted some loglevels (several info got downgraded to debug)
	* Removed --pgp2 in CPunk RSA pings.
	* Append random garbage to pings so they have different
	  lengths.
	  new options:
	    - random_gabage (default: 8192)
	      Garbage length is chosen uniformly from 0 to random_gabage
	      bytes.
	    - dev_urandom (default: /dev/urandom)
	      where to read garbage from (more generally: non-blocking
	      (low-quality) randomless source)
	* Chain pinging:  Echolot now finds broken chains.
	  new options:
	     - do_chainpings (default: 1)
	       Whether to do chain pinging.
	     - show_chainpings (default: 1)
	       Whether to show the result of our chain pinging in the
	       public stats.
	   Several other settings control the details of chain pinging.
	   You probably don't want or need to tweak them. See
	   the pingd.conf(5) manual page for details.
	   - Also adds the new "sendchainpings" command.
	* Create an index.txt file in the thesaurus directory which
	  holds id, nick, and address for each remailer in the thesaurus.
	  This helps additional tools to utilize Echolot's data.
	* Compile a list of default From: lines as well as a list of
	  remailers which allow user supplied From headers.
	* Print status summary to log daily.
	   - Also adds the new "summary" command.
	* Reliable and CRLF - a neverending (sad) story.
	* Handle situations better in which a ping is received when the
	  key already has been expired.

Changes in version 2.0.10 - 2003-02-03
	* Return undef rather than 0 if we cannot open a Maildir.
	* Add missing use of Carp to Echolot::Storage::File.pm.

Changes in version 2.0.9 - 2003-01-14
	* Logging is finally cleaned up. There are two new config options:
	  logfile and loglevel.
	* Automatically remove stale .pid files.
	* Trash messages with errors immediately rather than storing them
	  in mailerrordir forever.

Changes in version 2.0.8 - 2003-01-13
	* Work around a bug that let pingd die in certain random cases when
	  dealing with unuseable PGP keys (like expired keys).
	  Talk with Frank Tobin from GnuPG::Interface fame led to the diagnosis
	  that pingd gets a SIGPIPE since the GnuPG process already exited.
	* Removed a duplicate line from v2legend.
	* Allow periods in hostname.
	* Don't use GnuPG::Interface's recipients when encrypting any more as
	  it is broken with at least GnuPG 1.2.1.
	* Always use --no-secmem-warning with GnuPG calls.
	* Also use supported remailers from type2 only remailers.
	* Reset metadata if status is not defined.

Changes in version 2.0.7 - 2002-12-18
	* Added upgrade HOWTO.

Changes in version 2.0.6 - 2002-12-18
	* Have support for translated templates
	* The templates now make use of CSS.
	* Minor documentation fixes by Colin Tuckley
	* thesaurusindexfile and indexfilebasename config values should no
	  longer have the extension (.html) in them
	* Fix v2 stats for cypherpunk remailers by using right column title.
	* Use '(no subject)' instead of '' as a subject if none is
	  otherwise chosen.

Changes in version 2.0.5 - 2002-10-25
	* Only take default parameters if they are not set in
	  pingd.conf (as opposed to set to undef).
	* Also support setups without user defined mailboxes
	  (recipient_delimiter set to '').

Changes in version 2.0.4 - 2002-10-16
	* Fix pingd.conf(5) manpage a bit (indention levels).

Changes in version 2.0.3 - 2002-10-12
	* Set program name according to current action.
	* Fix a typo that showed up in perl 5.0005_02 (had a , instead of a .
	  in an open() when reading mboxen as input).

Changes in version 2.0.2 - 2002-09-21
	* Die immeditatly if there is no Version information in metadata.
	* Make regular backups of metadata and rotate them properly.

Changes in version 2.0.1 - 2002-09-21
	* Store unkown fields from mix summary lines and put them in keyrings.

Changes in version 2.0 - 2002-09-17
	* New version number, this is 2.0, really!
	* Minor spelling fixes.
	
Changes in version 2.0rc3 - 2002-09-12
	* Write SENDMAIL to mix.cfg
	* Add sendpings command.
	* Only decrease a remailer's ttl during requesting -conf if
	  it was requested by the usualy timer run and not by the
	  user.
	* Template cleanup: fix a link and add links to .txt versions
	  to front page.
	* Have install-perl-modules tool.
	* Spelling fixes.
	* seperate_rlists was renamed to separate_rlists.
	* README was improved.

Changes in version 2.0rc2 - 2002-09-08
	* Reopen stdin to /dev/null instead of closing it to avoid
	  perl 5.8 warnings.

Changes in version 2.0rc1 - 2002-09-05
	* new version number.
	* Random spelling fixes.
	* Do not show hidden remailers in thesaurus.

Changes in version 2.0beta34 - 2002-09-04
	* Make ping/request time more random.
	* Encrypt pings (symmetrically), so that dup detection of some
	  remailers (austria) fails and pings get processed.
	* Write total number of unique remailers to echolot.html.

Changes in version 2.0beta33 - 2002-08-23
	* Scheduler fixes (inserted jobs for one time processing got requeued
	  over and over again according to their interval).
	* Give a short summary about current stats on index page.

Changes in version 2.0beta32 - 2002-08-23
	* Fix a major bug introduced in 2.0beta31 that resulted in no
	  remailer-xxx queries beeing sent out.

Changes in version 2.0beta31 - 2002-08-21
	* Have a consistent name for the ~/echolot directory in README.
	* If you request keyconf from only a few remailers, more requests could
	  have been sent. Fixed that.
	* Write REMAIL n to mix.cfg - apparently it defaults to yes, which
	  means Mixmaster will want to create keys.
	* Fix random typos.
	* Fix pingctl script.

Changes in version 2.0beta30 - 2002-08-15
	* Write NAME and ADDRESS to mix.cfg - mix cannot figure it out
	  if detached.

Changes in version 2.0beta29 - 2002-08-14
	* Create .meta files with the expiry date of pages.
	* Also put the expiry date in HTML meta headers.
	* Make indexfilebasename a configure option.
	* Code cleanup: renamed some functions.

Changes in version 2.0beta28 - 2002-08-13
	* Write a standard mix.cfg configuration file for mixmaster.
	  It only sets PUBRING and TYPE2LIST. Needed for systems where
	  those values are overriden by systemwide defaults.

Changes in version 2.0beta27 - 2002-08-13
	* Some small fixes to the Debian Package

Changes in version 2.0beta26 - 2002-08-12
	* Fix a few typos in the echolot.html template.
	* Added /etc/echolot/pingd.conf to the list of configfiles.
	* Have a debian/ directory to build a Debian package.
	* Config option mailindir was renamed to mailin. You now
	  can also point it to a mbox format mailbox.
	* Have --quiet.
	* Stricter permissions for most newly created directories (go-rwx).

Changes in version 2.0beta25 - 2002-08-10
	* Produce echolot.html, an index file for echolot results.
	
Changes in version 2.0beta24 - 2002-08-10
	* Remove »x« from end of pubring.mix summary lines.

Changes in version 2.0beta23 - 2002-08-07
	* Unlinking Thesaurus files works now.
	* Detach correctly now.

Changes in version 2.0beta22 - 2002-08-05
	* Actually use the sane basedir. *sigh*

Changes in version 2.0beta21 - 2002-08-05
	* Using a sane basedir by default. You no longer need to specify
	  it in pingd.conf.

Changes in version 2.0beta20 - 2002-08-02
	* Added pingctl wrapper to tools.
	* echolot --help now gives a brief list of commands.
	* Added acknowledgements.

Changes in version 2.0beta19 - 2002-07-29
	* Build keyrings in results.private too

Changes in version 2.0beta18 - 2002-07-23
	* Allow for inclusion of broken chain reports and same operator/machine
	  lists in stats pages. Broken chain reports are not generated
	  automatically; this is planned for a later release.  For now you need
	  to supply this information in the files broken1.txt, broken2.txt, and
	  sameop.txt.

Changes in version 2.0beta17 - 2002-07-22
	* You no longer need an extra Mixmaster installation for your pinger.
	  Echolot can make use of any Mixmaster binary you alread have
	  installed.
	* The config hash »Pinger::Mix« is obsolete now. Please set
	  »mixmaster« to the path of your mix executeable. Echolot now
	  uses its own mix directory below echolothome by default (config
	  option mixhome).
	* The default gnupghome has changed from »gnupg« to »gnupghome«.
	* New config option »gnupg«.
	* Not the current time but the scheduled start time is used when
	  deciding which remailers to ping. This is nice if we get delayed for
	  whatever reason.
	* Changed URL in templates to point to www.palfrader.org/echolot
	  instead of the savannah page.
	
	How to upgrade (assuming you have a default configuration):
	   ./pingd stop
	   mv gnupg gnupghome
	   vi pingd.conf (remove Pinger::Mix, set mixmaster;
	                  cf. pingd.conf.sample )
	  ./pingd [...] start

Changes in version 2.0beta16 - 2002-07-17
	* Do not send all pings for the same remailer at the same time
	* The cheap hashing function that was used for determining when to ping
	  was replaced by md5. The local secret also is an input to the
	  function so not all echolot pingers ping the same remailer at the
	  same time.
	* In the distribution the pingd.conf file has been renamed to pingd.conf.
	  So it should be possible to just untar the new tar.gz over the old
	  installation (you have a backup anyway, don't you?).
	* The getkeyconf command takes optional addresses to request config
	  data from.
	* The getkeyconf config option was replaced by getkeyconf_interval and
	  getkeyconf_every_nth_time. Not all requests are sent at the same time
	  any more.
	* Stats can be sorted by latency rather than nick. Set
	  stats_sort_by_latency if you want that.

Changes in version 2.0beta15 - 2002-07-16
	* Have echolot version in stats HTML pages
	* Random documentation fixes
	* Make it runs with older perls (5.005_03 is tested)
          - always pass two arguments to mkdir()
	  - import SEEK_ constants from POSIX rather than Fcntl
	  - do not use warnings

Changes in version 2.0beta14 - 2002-07-16
	* Added commands buildstats buildkeys and buildthesaurus
	* Added legend to templates (Orange)
	* Thesaurus building failed when an id did not return a
	  valid remailer. A check was there bug it was wrong
	* Have pingd.conf.5 manpage documenting all options

Changes in version 2.0beta13 - 2002-07-13
	* Have correct title tags and some layout changes in the HTML templates
	* Encode HTML Entities in HTML Stats
	* Only show valid remailers in Thesaurus
	* Support »not a remailer« reply to remailer-xxx
	* Make sure only the right keys are exported to the pgp keyrings
	* Do not skip key if GnuPG returns something in stderr with
	  remailer-key replies

Changes in version 2.0beta12 - 2002-07-11
	* Cut strings when they do not fit in the table formats
	* Sort type2.list/pubring.mix

Changes in version 2.0beta11 - 2002-07-11
	* Don't run in Taint mode anymore per default.
	  If you still want it, trimm your PATH to something acceptable
	  for perl and add »-T« to the first line of pingd.

Changes in version 2.0beta10 - 2002-07-11
	* Don't reset PATH to /usr/bin:/bin any more (Yes, again)
	* Documentation updates

Changes in version 2.0beta9 - 2002-07-11
	* Don't reset PATH to /usr/bin:/bin any more
	* Use confess or cluck instead of croak in some places.

Changes in version 2.0beta8 - 2002-07-10
	* Fix public clist.

Changes in version 2.0beta7 - 2002-07-10
	* fixed a stupid syntax bug.

Changes in version 2.0beta6 - 2002-07-10
	* Did away with Mail::Internet. Using local sendmail binary only.
	  This also means the smarthost config option is obsolete and there
	  is a sendmail config option now.

Changes in version 2.0beta5 - 2002-07-10
	* Thesaurus filenames changed from nn-foo to nn.foo.
	  Use the change-thesaurus-filenames script in the tools
	  directory to convert your current thesaurus if you wish
	  to keep the data.
	* Seperate rlists for rsa, dsa and plaintext pings are
	  supported now. Enable seperate_rlists in pingd.conf.
	* Have a combined list. Enable with combined_list in pingd.conf.

Changes in version 2.0beta4 - 2002-07-10
	* Minor documentation fixes
	* Added --process switch
	* Die if metadata or conf data cannot be parsed
	* Build manpage into extra file

Changes in version 2.0beta3 - 2002-07-10
	* Fixed a small bug with writing the metadata so that it could not be
	  parsed again

Changes in version 2.0beta2 - 2002-07-10
	* Moved from XML to Data::Dumper
	  Use convert-xml-to-datadumper in the tools directory to
	  convert your setup:
	    pingd stop
	    mv pingd.conf pingd.conf.old
	    mv data/metadata data/metadata.old
	    convert-xml-to-datadumper CONFIG < pingd.conf.old > pingd.conf
	    convert-xml-to-datadumper METADATA < data/metadata.old > data/metadata
	    pingd start

Changes in version 2.0beta1 - 2002-07-07
	* Initial public beta test
