Description: Pinger for anonymous remailers such as Mixmaster
 A Pinger in the context of anonymous remailers is a program that
 regularly sends messages through remailers to determine their status.
 Based on the responses, the Pinger calculates reliability statistics
 which may be used by remailer clients to choose a chain of remailers to
 use.
 .
 Furthermore, Echolot collects configuration parameters and keys of
 remailers and offers the collected information in a format readable by
 remailer clients.  This helps reduce the administration effort required
 to use or host remailers.
