Echolot for Debian
------------------

Make sure mail to the Echolot pinger reaches /var/mail/echolot (or configure
echolot to read it from any other location). Please really check that mail to
the configured domain works. Any bounces will annoy dozends of remailer
operators.

To send commands to pingd it's best to use the /etc/init.d/echolot script.
It takes care that pingd is only called as the correct user. See pingd(1) for a
list of commands and their description.

If you run this pinger please consider publishing the results so that other
people benefit from it. Announcing the URL to the remailer operators' list
<remops@freedom.gmsociety.org>, the alt.privacy.anon-server Usenet newsgroup
and sending a mail to pingers@palfrader.org would be appreciated.

Since many users installed Echolot without considering its implications the
default setup is now to no longer start the pingd in the default installation.
To actually enable it please modify /etc/default/echolot.

If you want to run a pinger, please configure /etc/echolot/pingd.conf and
/etc/default/echolot.  Then start echolot using /etc/init.d/echolot start
and add some addresses to it: /etc/init.d/echolot add remailer@example.com.
