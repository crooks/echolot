	Default: none
	Example: 'sitename' => 'testsite',

=item B<my_localpart>

The local part of the pinger's email address.

It is used in several templates.

=back



=head2 SYSTEM SPECIFIC OPTIONS

=over

=item B<recipient_delimiter>

The B<recipient_delimiter> parameter specifies the separator between user names
and address extensions (user+foo).

	Default: 'recipient_delimiter' => '+',
	Example: 'recipient_delimiter' => '-',

as the MAC hash function.

B<hash_len> is the number of characters to include in the email address.
