for 2.0:
 make setup easy/document setup
 only fetch keys and confs remailers if fetch is set
 make a private [rm]list showing all remailers
 ping cpunk without pgponly in clear too
 configure pinging options (i.e. cpunkt-{rsa,dsa,none}, mix)
 add showconf command

for later:
 rotate secret
 get rid of dependency on mix
 get rid of dependency on gnupg
 list broken chains
 ping nymservers
