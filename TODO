        . Partially done
        o Done
        D Deferred
        X Abandoned

 - updated information with from lines
 - don't send that many messages with From Headers
 - optionally log messages wich raise problems
 - close and open files instead of keeping all the files open
 - make 'not a remailer' check not that strict

can be done later:
 - allow capsstring overrides/additions
 - check gnupg version number on startup
 - chain preload and postload
 D have a way to always have certain keys in the keyring
   (manually add nym's keyrings)
   This is not necessary if we add real nymserv pinging
 D rotate secret
 D parse bounces and mark pings as dead immediatly
 D separate keys in remailer-key reply if they share the same armor (cmeclex is
   the only one doing this. AARG)
 D query other stat pages for new remailers
 D ping nymservers
 D ping mail2news gates
 D ping remailer -> usenet, summarize from lines
 X have different stats philosophies (pessimist, optimist..)
 X get rid of dependency on mix
 X get rid of dependency on gnupg
 X have a timeout on GPG calls (nonblocking IO should solve the problem)
