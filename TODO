Legend:
        - Not done
        * Top priority
        . Partially done
        o Done
        D Deferred
        X Abandoned

 - Print summary to log daily

can be done later:
 - have different stats philosophies (pessimist, optimist..)
 - allow capsstring overrides/additions
 - check gnupg version number on startup
 - have a way to always have certain keys in the keyring
   (manually add nym's keyrings)
   This is not necessary if we add real nymserv pinging
 - ping nymservers
 - chain preload and postload
 D rotate secret
 D parse bounces and mark pings as dead immediatly
 D separate keys in remailer-key reply if they share the same armor (cmeclex is
   the only one doing this. AARG)
 D query other stat pages for new remailers
 X get rid of dependency on mix
 X get rid of dependency on gnupg
