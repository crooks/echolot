 - normal distribution is plain out wrong for latency
   - change to median for the latency column
   - assumption on whether a ping is lost should be
     changed from the normal distribution caluclation
     to quantiles
 - updated information with from lines
 - fix pingtcl to wait for pingd to shut down
      (like the Debian package already does)
 - optimize chain pinger:
   cache callids in chainpinging - md5 is not that cheap
 - check behaviour if we lag behind schedule
   - some events can't be missed (there's no point in scheduling 20 buildstats)
     some can't (pinging)
 - clean up tmp files


can be done later:
 - ping mail2news gates
 - ping remailer -> usenet, summarize from lines
 - have different stats philosophies (pessimist, optimist..)
 - allow capsstring overrides/additions
 - check gnupg version number on startup
 - have a way to always have certain keys in the keyring
   (manually add nym's keyrings)
   This is not necessary if we add real nymserv pinging
 - ping nymservers
 - chain preload and postload
 D rotate secret
 D parse bounces and mark pings as dead immediatly
 D separate keys in remailer-key reply if they share the same armor (cmeclex is
   the only one doing this. AARG)
 D query other stat pages for new remailers
 X get rid of dependency on mix
 X get rid of dependency on gnupg
