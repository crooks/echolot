for 2.0:
 document configuration options
 the stats pages need legends for the histories, options
 it would be nice if the html pages also had links to the .txt versions of the
  stats (in addition to the v1 v2 html links)

can be done later, nice if for 2.0:
 getkeyconf command could take option:  address [address ...]
 list broken chains
 ping nymservers
 chain preload and postload
 parse bounces and mark pings as dead immediatly
 rotate secret
 get rid of dependency on mix
 get rid of dependency on gnupg
 seperate keys in remailer-key reply if they share the same armor (cmeclex is
   the only one doing this. AARG)
