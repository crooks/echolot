for 2.0:
 Why does austria perform that bad with mix pings.

can be done later, nice if for 2.0:
 getkeyconf command could take option:  address [address ...]
 list broken chains
 ping nymservers
 chain preload and postload
 parse bounces and mark pings as dead immediatly
 rotate secret
 get rid of dependency on mix
 get rid of dependency on gnupg
 seperate keys in remailer-key reply if they share the same armor (cmeclex is
   the only one doing this. AARG)
